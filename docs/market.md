## About

Researching potential applications of reproducible compute applications performed by a decentralized network orchestrated with agent-based modeling (including ML-driven) for competitive pricing/scheduling, using blockchain to perform collateral transfer after validation incentivizing the participation in the network:

- Decentralized Computing

- Decentralized Storage

- Decentralized Bandwidth

- Decentralized Smart Grid Management: devices decide how to allocate energy produced and consumed in a grid of sensors, generators and utilities.

- Decentralized Supply Chain Management: Decentralized Logistics. You record on chain the assets you need to ship, from where to where, you offer, people can see the offer and can accept it, if they have the right car (hardware). When they ship they validate, if validation is good, they get payed. AWS is to Decentralized computing as Amazon Shipping is to this thing.

- Decentralized IoT-based services.

### Akash Network

Compute resources marketplace, permissionless cloud resources, the AKT Token is used to incentivize participants.

Cost-effective supercloud, more than 80% cheaper than AWS, GPC, Azure.

Providers deploy standardized (Kubernetes) infrastructure, tenants define Docker containers of jobs and they deploy them using the network, functioning as some kind of broker of jobs and resources. The value proposition is the distruction of monolith acting as monopolies (AWS) with less competitive pricing and less infrastructural flexibility. The main challange is the managing of an heterogeneus and non-stationary system.
