# simulations

A list of the simulations we need to run

Need to be able to vary the following parameters:

* taxation rate
  * for maximum flexibility, should be able to be different for every deal
* the percent of taxes that go jackpot versus somewhere else
* where jackpots payouts go
* the amount staked by nodes to other nodes
* the allocation of rewards from dPoS
* number of nodes in consortium
* consensus threshold in consortium
* how consortium nodes are chosen
* maximum subset of nodes in a single mediation process
* reward for announcing successful cheating
* client collateral
* collateral multiplier
* timeout collateral
* cheating collateral
* computation rate collateral
* frequency/probability of checking result
* reputation metrics? 
* payment for/amount of time that inputs/outputs are stored
*
